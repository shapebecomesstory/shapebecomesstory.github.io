The left hand image is a photograph of a projection against a white screen. In the center of the projection is a transparency with black text printed in a sans serif font. The text reads: "Getting into material is the access point to finding ease, or play. Content is always accessed through material and process (play). When I make, I think through embodiment and material play. This, for me, is an access point to my tomboy."

The right hand image is an animated gif showing a series of projections being moved by Carmen's hands. The projections show a variety of small shapes cut out from paper. Beginning with the shapes laid out at random, Carmen rearranges them to form a grinning face and then a car with trees in the backdrop.
