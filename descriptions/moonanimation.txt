An animated gif of a collage made out of red, brown, black, and beige paper cutouts of various shapes. The gif starts with a shot of an abstract depiction of a white landscape with red, reed-like shapes standing vertically on the left side of the foreground. Above the landscape is a sky colored in with gray brushstrokes and small brown star cutouts. In the upper right hand corner is rust-colored circle of paper depicting a full moon.

The gif then cuts to a red face in the center against a black and gray background with similar red, reed-like shapes on the left and right sides. As the animation progresses, the face is covered and uncovered by a white moon waxing and waning through a full cycle of phases. Paper star cutouts flash in and out all around the face.
