Scanned chapbook pages with the poem "living btwn the lines" by Andriniki Mattis against a tan background. The text of the poem is arranged in three columns, and it reads:

living btwn the lines

i walk this rod
of a body
attracting lightning
at every turn
wonder &
how ceilings can
put a cap to what
can be beauty
named a fleeting
thing
not made for my
hands
i lie
a cut flower in
stems in protest
on streets
gushing with
a hydra of people
who all beg
a peering into
with all that can be seen at
a minute arrival
of eyes exchanging a glance into
the heaving of inner worlds

by what it will outlive

my eyes smolder
the pelvis of my mouth
disowning the limbs of sound
brush fire at my throat & in this
life
the leaves never turn
without the shape
of leaving
o to be
forcibly open
closing holding&
	each person who
	ever walked this
	tightrope body

my collarbone leaves space
for the tips of another's hands
such pining
evenly carved into the body a
moon holding its circle while
appearing bitten into
a sacred hollow
isn't this what breathing is for &

i stand on pavement
slanting towards sunlight
this plywood chest
warmed sweetly by sun
a city beating with peopled
footsteps the luxury of a
consciousness wearing through
my skin my spine a petrified
wood
the axe comes
says my gender
does not
belong to me
this paper body
unfolding origami
this unripe fruit
devoured of color
if this is the day that becomes everyday
then tomorrow must be a folded horizon
losing its crease a bud opening
unveiling skin
a rippled ocean
earth below mined of its
wick &who am i to be
treated
if land can be ruled
by what it will outlive
