A large sheet of yellow paper displayed in a landscape orientation against a bright pink background. The paper has multiple creases from being folded that split the spread into four columns. From left to right, the first, second, and last columns are filled with teal text. Additionally, the right half of the sheet has a cartoon-like drawing in light gray ink of a person lying in a bathtub.

The first column of text reads:
"In the mornings I eat yogurt.
it coats the roof

of my mouth.

Coffee burns

my tongue and leaves a film
in my throatâ€”I drink it faster.

In my dream L---

was mad at me. I tell them so as
I'm putting bread

in the oven. Big red oven mitts
cover my forearms and I heave
the dutch ovens up onto the
stove. I take the lids off and
the trivets
shudder and clang. Lotte apologizes
for my dream of them."

In the first column, the last word of numerous lines are boxed and repeated as the first words in the lines of the second column, where they are also boxed. The repeating words are connected by straight horizontal lines that connect the two columns. The second column reads:

"yogurt: cow's milk or goat's milk
roof: top of or covering of or what I
mean is the spot behind my teeth

mouth: red and ridged and damp and
sensitive

burns: I'll feel the singe for the rest
of the day

film: viscous and lingering

faster: the faster I drink, the more
time I'm drinking and the less
time I'm touch my tongue to
the roof of my mouth. the less
time I'm trying to swallow away
the film. the less time I'm
tonguing tasting

L---: sleeps in the room next to mine.
groggy in the morning wearing a
button up

bread: flour water salt yeast. risen
overnight. shaped an hour before
right now

oven mitts: thank you to S--'s mum
heave: they're cast iron and heavy

trivets: the metal spiders over the fire"

The final column of text on the rightmost side of the page reads:
"I ate microwaved pears
wearing pink paisley nightie
in the not shared
bed of my parents.
Freaky Friday on the telly
the fourth time that week.

Lollipop in the bathwater.
run under the tap
hot clear melting red
He boiled water
in a saucepan.
scalded thin hair.

Close enough to the ceiling
I wiped snot on
pea green walls
When we moved so
did the bunk bed.
streaks too tall
stayed and so
did my name in
the closet.

I read books about bellies
I squirmed in my sheets
I screamed when the
cat climbed the ladder."
