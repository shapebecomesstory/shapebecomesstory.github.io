From left to right, the images are as follows:

A scan of a single page of the zine against a goldenrod colored background. Printed in Purple Risograph on white paper, Lukaza's block letters fill the page with uneven text breaks that slow the reading of the phrase "Look through with your eyes & take a picture & draw it".

This page of the zine features two photos, printed in grainy deep purple Risograph, of people using viewfinders in the world. Both are  accompanied by small prompts in Lukaza's all caps handwriting such as "Let your view-finder guide you on a walk in your neighborhood". The page is scanned against a goldenrod colored background.

A single page of the zine featuring a purple risograph print of Lukaza's partner HH in a desert landscape holding a viewfinder to the sky, captured through, and framed by, Luakaza's own viewfinder. Underneath, their handwritten text reads "your walk might lead you to new places, be fluid, trust the slowness of the walk". The page is scanned against a goldenrod colored background.

The back cover scanned on a goldenrod colored background, vertically bound with a yellow plastic coil. A simple line drawing depicts a hand holding a sheet of paper to the sky. A triangular di cut turns the line drawn paper and literal back cover sheet into a viewfinder. The cut out also reveals a bit of the page underneath, framing a purple riso print of Lukaza's shadow tenderly pinching a square viewfinder.
