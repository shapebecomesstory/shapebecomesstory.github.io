A photograph of a two-page spread of the title page from the "Wonders of the Moon" volume from the Illustrated Library of Wonders, published in 1873. The edges of gray clothbound hardcovers can be seen behind the open pages, and the photographer's hand can be seen holding the book open along its bottom edge.

The lefthand side has a detailed, full-page image of the moon in a black sky. Marks of craters and ridges can be seen all over the moon's surface. The righthand page reads:

"WONDERS
of
THE MOON.
