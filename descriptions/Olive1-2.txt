The left hand image shows a manila envelope that has been filled in with black ink except for its flap and an illustration in its center of a sticky note with the words "PLEASE TAKE!" written on it. The envelope is displayed against a bright pink background.

The right hand image also has the same pink background. In the center, it shows a blank white page that is just large enough to fit in the envelope. Teal text is printed around the page's top, right, and bottom edges. The top edge reads, "Write/draw/make/cut-out" followed by an arrow that bends down the right edge. Then along the right edge, the text says, "a manifesto" followed by a series of asterisks. The bottom edge is lined with dashes.
