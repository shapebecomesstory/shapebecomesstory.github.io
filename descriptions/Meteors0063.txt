A photograph of page 4 of the book "Meteors, Aerolites, Storms, and Atmospheric Phenomena" from the Illustrated Library of Wonders, published in 1876. The page is slightly yellowed, and the edges a green clothbound hardcover can be seen behind the page. The photographer's finger can be seen on the left edge of the photo, holding the book open.

Two paragraphs on the page are highlighted when the user hovers their mouse over the page. The first reads:

"Yes, there is no doubt of it; history attests the fact; the earliest nations thought that the stars were animated, living bodies. In their eyes the heavenly bodies were superior beings, good or bad deities, friends or enemies, and ever ready to engage in conflicts of which the issue might be favorable or injurious to mortals."

The second reads:

"The Aurora, or Dawn, itself was one of these divinities, and the most charming of them. Always beautiful with freshness and youth, she was ever saluted and hailed with gratitude, because she it was who came the first to announce the defeat of the powers of darkness and evil, and each morning, like a tender and faithful messenger, awoke the sons of men."
