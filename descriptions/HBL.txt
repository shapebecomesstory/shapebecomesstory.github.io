Three stacked illustrations that line up to create the figure of a person. Each image alternates between two different illustrations when clicked by the user. The top images are of heads, the centers are of torsos, and the bottoms legs. The sections are divided by a thin yellow line.

In the first set of head-body-leg illustrations, the head shows a blond-haired person who is frowning. They wear a tall, black rimmed hat with a teal band wrapped around it with the letters "M.H.P." The torso wears a teal collared shift underneath a black dress with a red circle on the left side of the chest. The person holds a yellow cane horizontally behind their back. The legs are crossed and covered by black tights and boots. Beneath the feet is a teal checkerboard pattern and two small dogs with black and yellow patches. The right side dog holds a bone in its mouth.

In the second set of illustrations, the head shows another blond-haired person with a long neck and their mouth open as if singing. They wear a straw hat with a yellow and black striped ribbon tied around it. They also wear a yellow and black striped bowtie. The torso illustration is of a red and gray pinstriped blazer over a white collared shirt and black necktie. The hands hold a booklet that says "Zebra Song," and there is a zebra standing in the background of the image. The legs stand straight and are covered in teal striped tights tucked into black, laced boots.
