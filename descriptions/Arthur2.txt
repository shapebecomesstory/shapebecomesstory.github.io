A full two-page spread of a black and white illustration, scanned against a red background. In the illustration, white letters, figures, and lines are set in front of a black background. The most prominent elements in the image are two short-haired figures, haloed, winged, and wearing heeled boots. Their hands are locked as if arm wrestling, and they are sweating from the temples. Their elbows rest on a flat cracked surface. Scattered beneath them are smaller drawings of various images: from the leftmost to rightmost edges, there is a transparent grid in a cube shape; an abstract outline of an amoebic shape with small, wave-like squiggles all throughout and a solid tree branch-like shape at the center; a teacup on its side with liquid spilling out; and a small, simple chair. Along the top of the spread in all caps is the phrase "CAN'T CRUSH OUR," which is completed by the word "SPIRIT" at the bottom center.
