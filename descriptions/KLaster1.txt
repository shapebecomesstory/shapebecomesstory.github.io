Scan of a yellow page against a lavender background. The page shows a risograph print of a quote by Audre Lorde. The quote is contained in a black, asymmetrical starburst shape, and the letters, cut out from the starburst, are the same yellow as the rest of the page. The lettering is in all caps and arranged so that it fits tightly within the bounds of the starburst. The text reads: "'I am going to write fire until it comes out of my ears, my eyes, my noseholes -- everywhere. Until it's every breath I breathe.' -Audre Lorde"
