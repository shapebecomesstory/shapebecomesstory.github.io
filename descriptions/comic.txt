Four scans of a fold-out comic held up by Carmen's hands against a gray background. The panels feature blue, green, and  gray illustrations interspersed with black text.

The first scan is of the comic's first panel, which shows a collage of green trees in front of a blue sky with clouds and a rising sun. The text reads: "First, I was a cloud. Every morning, Dawn and I would pull the strings of the day, as if every tree were a paper cut-out we'd raise from flat to standing."

In the second scan, the top half of the first panel opens to reveal blue and gray clouds against a white sky with more green trees along the bottom. The text reads: "As the day progressed, I changed shape as my memories passed through me. Children would lay on their backs and watch me in the sky."

The third scan shows a different closed panel with a blue figure sitting on top of a large gray circle of crinkled paper, suspended by ropes as if on a swing. An even layer of green waves runs along the bottom of the page. The text reads: "I missed the vast sky. That night, I went to the river, when I knew Dusk would be there, pulling the strings of the day shut. I swam out to where the moon meets the horizon, and I rode the moon as Dusk raised it up."

The final scan shows the same panel with the top flap opened. Inside is a large green figure with their arms raised, standing against a large white circle and the faint shadow of a chain link fence. In the center of the figure is a blue circle with a white sliver along one side, like a crescent moon. The text reads: "Now, I am cloud and girl and anger and moon. I am head to toe. I am round and soft. I am edged, and huge, and tiny when you see me from far away."
