Scan of a light green page against a lavender background. The page shows a risograph print of a quote by Patricia Lockwood. The quote is contained in a red upright rectangle. The red coloring appears in splotches of different shades, mostly quite muted, but towards the top left corner there is a patch of bolder red. The letters of the quote are cut out from the rectangle, making them the same light green color as the page. The text reads: "'We were being radicalized, and how did that feel? Like we had just stepped into a girl scout uniform made of fire. Like the skies had abruptly shifted to the stripes of an old Soviet poster.' -Patricia Lockwood"
