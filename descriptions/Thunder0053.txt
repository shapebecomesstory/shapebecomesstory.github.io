A photograph of page 49 of the book "Thunder and Lightning" from the Illustrated Library of Wonders, published in 1875. The page is yellowed and slightly worn at the edges from age.

The chapter title "Mysterious Aureola" is printed at the top of the page. Two passages are highlighted. The first reads:

"But it is when the electric matter flows quietly towards the heavens, and takes for its pole the body of man himself, that the spectacle is truly marvellous."

The second reads:

"It is incontestable that these strange phenomena are not entirely contrary to physical principles, and that philosophers and sages might be more or less favoured by the hidden lights of nature. Nothing prevents our supposing that nervous impressionable individuals, as the interpreters dreams or visions generally are, may be such good conductors of electricity as to occasion these spontaneous discharges of electric fluid."
