A full-page illustration in black & white, scanned against a red background. The illustration's background is comprised of a repeating white botanical pattern against a black backdrop, where each tile of the pattern is hexagonal and depicts six stems of fruit and leaves growing outwards from a central point. In the upper left hand corner, a section of a white chain link fence can be seen behind the repeating pattern. The number "16" is also written sideways twice along the right edge of the page. In the center of the page is a drawing of a person with splayed limbs, nude except for black boots, and with the head turned to the side. Directly above the figure is a large flower with a curved black stem and a large bloom with black and white petals. All along the upper contour of the flower reads the following text in squiggly letters: "All flowers in time bend toward the sun".
